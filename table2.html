<h1>Cassidy Harvey's facts</h1>

<ul>
 <li>I am a 2nd year student that just trasnferred from Valdosta State University to University of Georgia. At valdosta  I was involved in Greek life, the sorority I was in was Kappa Delta. After transferring I went early Alumni. This means that I “graduated” from my sorority. </li>
 <li> I also managed to hold a position while in Kappa Delta. I was the assistant vice president for Finance. I am not very good at finance. I did not pay my dues very well, which is ironic because I was the finance chair. I am proficient in Spanish on my resume but in reality I am not very good at it. </li> 
 <li> 
 I also learned very quickly that I am NOT destined to be a computer science major! College is not very fun and kind of hard to do. I am also secretly an Auburn fan and not a Georgia fan. But that is a secret because I could get mobbed. </li>
</ul>
